In addition to your findings, you should also include charts and graphs (visualizations) in your report. Visualizations help communicate the story the data is telling by making it more understandable and coherent. At the end of the report, add any recommendations you have for Louise based on your findings. Then add a descriptive commit message and click "Commit changes."
